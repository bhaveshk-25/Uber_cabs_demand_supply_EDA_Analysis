        "\n",
        "The project utilizes an Uber cab request dataset containing 6,745 records and 6 variables related to trip requests, pickup locations, time details, and trip outcomes.\n",
        "Data cleaning involved inspecting the dataset structure, validating data types, handling missing values in driver and drop-time fields (which were valid for unfulfilled trips), and standardizing categorical variables to ensure consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Preprocessing and Transformation :**\n",
        "\n",
        "Date and time columns were converted into appropriate datetime formats to enable temporal analysis.\n",
        "Additional features such as request hour and day of week were derived to analyze demand patterns across time.\n",
        "Indicator variables were created to support failure rate and completion rate analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization :**\n",
        "\n",
        "A combination of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis was performed using Python visualization libraries (matplotlib and seaborn).\n",
        "Visualizations included bar charts, line plots, stacked columns, and rate-based charts to examine relationships between demand, supply, trip status, time, and pickup location.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Insights**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Demand peaks during morning and evening hours, while supply does not scale proportionally during these periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "- No Cars Available is the primary reason for trip failures, exceeding user-initiated cancellations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Airport pickups consistently experience higher failure rates compared to city pickups.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Completion rates decline significantly during peak demand hours, indicating operational bottlenecks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Failure rates vary by hour, highlighting specific high-risk periods that require intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Business Impact**\n",
        "\n",
        "This EDA provides valuable insights into Uber’s operational challenges related to demand–supply imbalance.\n",
        "The findings can help stakeholders improve driver allocation strategies, design time-based incentives, optimize airport operations, and reduce trip failures.\n",
        "Overall, the analysis demonstrates how data-driven insights can enhance service reliability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency."
